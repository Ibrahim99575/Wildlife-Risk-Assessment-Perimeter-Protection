# animal-free-farming

Welcome to our GitHub repository for our farm security enhancement project using deep learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Our project aims to provide a comprehensive and effective solution to ensure farm security by detecting and classifying potential threats and notifying the farmer and concerned authorities through SMS alerts. The system uses a custom image dataset and a 360-degree rotatable camera that provides complete coverage of the farm. Our system is designed to detect both animals and individuals, and it can measure the distance of the target accurately. Additionally, it is equipped with features such as a jazz sound to distract animals, sound alerts for individuals who come too close to the camera, and session recording to detect any forced shutdowns. We are excited to share our project with the community and invite you to explore our repository, review our code, and offer feedback.
